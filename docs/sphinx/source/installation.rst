Installation of PyPop7
======================

In order to install *pypop7*, it is **highly recommended** to use the `Python3 <https://docs.python.org/3/>`_-based
virtual environment via `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_ or
`conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html>`_. `Anaconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/>`_ (or
its mini version `miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/>`_) is a very popular `Python`
programming platform of scientists and researchers especially for artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning
(ML) / data science (DS).

Pip via Python Package Index (PyPI)
-----------------------------------

Note that `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ is the package installer for Python. You can use it to install
various packages easily. For `pypop7`, please run the following **shell** command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pypop7

For Chinese users, sometimes the following PyPI configuration can be used to speedup the installation process
of `pypop7` owing to network blocking:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip config set global.index-url https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/
    pip config set install.trusted-host mirrors.aliyun.com

rather than the default PyPI setting:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip config set global.index-url https://pypi.org/simple
    pip config set install.trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org

If the latest cutting-edge version is preferred, you can install directly from the GitHub repository of `pypop7`:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/Evolutionary-Intelligence/pypop.git
   cd pypop
   pip install -e .

Conda-based Virtual Environment
-------------------------------

You can first use the popular `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html>`_ tool to create
a virtual environment (e.g., named as `env_pypop7`):

.. code-block:: bash

    conda deactivate  # close exiting virtual env
    conda create -y --prefix env_pypop7  # free to change name of virtual env
    conda activate ./env_pypop7  # on Windows OS
    conda activate env_pypop7/  # on Linux
    conda activate env_pypop7  # on MacOS
    conda install -y --prefix env_pypop7 python=3.8.12  # create new virtual env
    pip install pypop7
    conda deactivate  # close current virtual env `env_pypop7`

Note that the above Python version (`3.8.12`) can be changed to meet your personal **Python3** version
(>=3.5 if possible).

Although we strongly recommend to use the the `conda` package manager to build the virtual environment as your working
space, currently we do not add this library to `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`_ and leave it for the future
(maybe 2024). As a result, you can only use `pip install pypop7` for `conda`.

For MATLAB Users
----------------

For Matlab users, `MATLAB-to-Python Migration Guide
<https://www.enthought.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Enthought-MATLAB-to-Python-White-Paper_.pdf>`_ or
`NumPy for MATLAB Users <https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html>`_ is highly recommended.

For R Users
-----------

For R (and S-Plus) users, `NumPy-for-R <https://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/r-numpy.html>`_
is highly recommended.

Uninstalling this Open-Source Library
-------------------------------------

If necessary, you could uninstall this open-source library *freely* with one simple command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip uninstall -y pypop7
