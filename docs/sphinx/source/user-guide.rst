Before applying this open-source library `PyPop7` in `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pypop7/>`_ to real-world
black-box optimization (BBO) problems, four basic information should be read sequentially, as presented in
the following:

* 1) Problem Definition,
* 2) Optimizer Setting,
* 3) Result Analysis,
* 4) Algorithm Selection and Configuration.

Problem Definition
------------------

First, an *objective function* (also called *fitness function* in this library) needs to be defined in the `function
<https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function-definitions>`_ form. Then, the standard data
structure `dict <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries>`_ is used as a simple yet
effective way to store all settings related to the optimization problem at hand, such as:
  * `fitness_function`: objective/cost function to be **minimized** (`func`),
  * `ndim_problem`: number of dimensionality (`int`),
  * `upper_boundary`: upper boundary of the search range (`array_like`),
  * `lower_boundary`: lower boundary of the search range (`array_like`).

Note that without loss of generality, only the **minimization** process is considered in this library, since
*maximization* can be easily transferred to *minimization* by negating it.

Below is a simple example to define the well-known test function `Rosenbrock
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function>`_ from the optimization community:

    .. code-block:: python
       :linenos:

       >>> import numpy as np
       >>> def rosenbrock(x):  # define the fitness (cost/objective) function
       ...     return 100.0*np.sum(np.power(x[1:] - np.power(x[:-1], 2), 2)) + np.sum(np.power(x[:-1] - 1, 2))
       >>> ndim_problem = 1000  # define its settings
       >>> problem = {'fitness_function': rosenbrock,  # cost function
       ...            'ndim_problem': ndim_problem,  # dimension
       ...            'lower_boundary': -10.0*np.ones((ndim_problem,)),  # search boundary
       ...            'upper_boundary': 10.0*np.ones((ndim_problem,))}

When the fitness function itself involves other *input arguments* except the sampling point `x` (here we distinguish
*input arguments* and above *problem settings*), there are two simple ways to support this scenario:

* to create a `class <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#class-definitions>`_ wrapper, e.g.:

    .. code-block:: python
       :linenos:

       >>> import numpy as np
       >>> def rosenbrock(x, arg):  # define the fitness (cost/objective) function
       ...     return arg*np.sum(np.power(x[1:] - np.power(x[:-1], 2), 2)) + np.sum(np.power(x[:-1] - 1, 2))
       >>> class Rosenbrock(object):  # build a class wrapper
       ...     def __init__(self, arg):  # arg is an extra input argument
       ...         self.arg = arg
       ...     def __call__(self, x):  # for fitness evaluation
       ...         return rosenbrock(x, self.arg)
       >>> ndim_problem = 1000  # define its settings
       >>> problem = {'fitness_function': Rosenbrock(100.0),  # cost function
       ...            'ndim_problem': ndim_problem,  # dimension
       ...            'lower_boundary': -10.0*np.ones((ndim_problem,)),  # search boundary
       ...            'upper_boundary': 10.0*np.ones((ndim_problem,))}

* to utilize the easy-to-use unified interface provided for all optimizers in this library, e.g.:

    .. code-block:: python
       :linenos:

       >>> import numpy as np
       >>> def rosenbrock(x, args):
       ...     return args*np.sum(np.power(x[1:] - np.power(x[:-1], 2), 2)) + np.sum(np.power(x[:-1] - 1, 2))
       >>> ndim_problem = 10
       >>> problem = {'fitness_function': rosenbrock,
       ...            'ndim_problem': ndim_problem,
       ...            'lower_boundary': -5.0*np.ones((ndim_problem,)),
       ...            'upper_boundary': 5.0*np.ones((ndim_problem,))}
       >>> from pypop7.optimizers.es.maes import MAES  # which can be replaced by any other optimizer in this library
       >>> options = {'fitness_threshold': 1e-10,  # terminate when the best-so-far fitness is lower than 1e-10
       ...            'max_function_evaluations': ndim_problem*10000,  # maximum of function evaluations
       ...            'seed_rng': 0,  # seed of random number generation (which must be set for repeatability)
       ...            'sigma': 3.0,  # initial global step-size of Gaussian search distribution
       ...            'verbose': 500}  # to print verbose information every 500 generations
       >>> maes = MAES(problem, options)  # initialize the optimizer
       >>> results = maes.optimize(args=100.0)  # args as input arguments of fitness function except sampling point
       >>> print(results['best_so_far_y'], results['n_function_evaluations'])
       7.573e-11 15537

When there are multiple (>=2) input arguments except the sampling point `x`, all of them should be organized via
a `function` or `class` wrapper with only one input argument except the sampling point `x` (in `dict` or `tuple`
form).

For Advanced Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Typically,  two members `upper_boundary` and `lower_boundary` are enough for most end-users to control the search
range. However, sometimes for *benchmarking-of-optimizers* purpose (e.g., to avoid utilizing `symmetry and origin
<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10556788.2020.1808977>`_ to possibly bias the search), we add
two extra settings to control the initialization of the population/individual:

  * `initial_upper_boundary`: upper boundary only for initialization (`array_like`),
  * `initial_lower_boundary`: lower boundary only for initialization (`array_like`).

If *not* explicitly given, `initial_upper_boundary` and `initial_lower_boundary` are set to `upper_boundary` and
`lower_boundary`, respectively. When `initial_upper_boundary` and `initial_lower_boundary` are explicitly given,
the initialization of population/individual will be sampled from [`initial_lower_boundary`, `initial_upper_boundary`]
rather than [`lower_boundary`, `upper_boundary`].

Optimizer Setting
-----------------

This open-source library provides a *unified* API for hyper-parameter settings of all black-box optimizers. The following
algorithm options (all stored into a `dict <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries>`_ format)
are common for all black-box optimizers:

  * `max_function_evaluations`: maximum of function evaluations (`int`, default: `np.inf`),
  * `max_runtime`: maximal runtime to be allowed (`float`, default: `np.inf`),
  * `seed_rng`: seed for random number generation needed to be *explicitly* set (`int`).

At least one of two algorithm options (`max_function_evaluations` and `max_runtime`) should be set according to
the available computing resources or acceptable runtime (i.e., **problem-dependent**). For **repeatability**,
`seed_rng` should be *explicitly* set for random number generation (`RNG
<https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/>`_). Note that as different `NumPy` verions may use `different
<https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0019-rng-policy.html>`_ RNG implementations, **repeatability** is guaranteed mainly within
the same `NumPy` version.

Note that for any optimizer, its *specific* options/settings (see its API documentation for details) can be
naturally added into the `dict` data structure. Take the well-known `Cross-Entropy Method (CEM)
<https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11009-006-9753-0>`_ as an illustrative example. The settings of
*mean* and *std* of its Gaussian sampling distribution usually have a significant impact on the convergence
rate (see its `API <https://pypop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cem/scem.html>`_ for more details about its
hyper-parameters):

    .. code-block:: python
       :linenos:

       >>> import numpy as np
       >>> from pypop7.benchmarks.base_functions import rosenbrock  # function to be minimized
       >>> from pypop7.optimizers.cem.scem import SCEM
       >>> problem = {'fitness_function': rosenbrock,  # define problem arguments
       ...            'ndim_problem': 10,
       ...            'lower_boundary': -5.0*np.ones((10,)),
       ...            'upper_boundary': 5.0*np.ones((10,))}
       >>> options = {'max_function_evaluations': 1000000,  # set optimizer options
       ...            'seed_rng': 2022,
       ...            'mean': 4.0*np.ones((10,)),  # initial mean of Gaussian search distribution
       ...            'sigma': 3.0}  # initial std (aka global step-size) of Gaussian search distribution
       >>> scem = SCEM(problem, options)  # initialize the optimizer class
       >>> results = scem.optimize()  # run the optimization process
       >>> # return the number of function evaluations and best-so-far fitness
       >>> print(f"SCEM: {results['n_function_evaluations']}, {results['best_so_far_y']}")
       SCEM: 1000000, 10.328016143160333

Result Analysis
---------------

After the ending of optimization stage, all black-box optimizers return at least the following common results
(collected into a `dict <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries>`_ data structure)
in a **unified** way:
  * `best_so_far_x`: the best-so-far solution found during optimization,
  * `best_so_far_y`: the best-so-far fitness (aka objective value) found during optimization,
  * `n_function_evaluations`: the total number of function evaluations used during optimization (which never exceeds
    `max_function_evaluations`),
  * `runtime`: the total runtime used during the entire optimization stage (which does not exceed `max_runtime`),
  * `termination_signal`: the termination signal from three common candidates (`MAX_FUNCTION_EVALUATIONS`,
    `MAX_RUNTIME`, and `FITNESS_THRESHOLD`),
  * `time_function_evaluations`: the total runtime spent only in function evaluations,
  * `fitness`: a list of fitness (aka objective value) generated during the entire optimization stage.

When the optimizer option `saving_fitness` is set to `False`, `fitness` will be `None`. When the optimizer option
`saving_fitness` is set to an integer `n` (> 0), `fitness` will be a list of fitness generated every `n` function
evaluations. Note that both the *first* and *last* fitness are always saved as the *beginning* and *ending* of
optimization. In practice, setting `saving_fitness` properly could generate a **low-memory** data storage for final
optimization results.

Below is a simple example to visualize the *fitness convergence* procedure of Rechenberg’s (1+1)-Evolution
Strategy on the classical `sphere` function (one of the simplest test functions):

    .. code-block:: python
       :linenos:

       >>> import numpy as np  # https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-662-43505-2_44
       >>> import seaborn as sns
       >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
       >>> from pypop7.benchmarks.base_functions import sphere
       >>> from pypop7.optimizers.es.res import RES
       >>> sns.set_theme(style='darkgrid')
       >>> plt.figure()
       >>> for i in range(3):
       >>>     problem = {'fitness_function': sphere,
       ...                'ndim_problem': 10}
       ...     options = {'max_function_evaluations': 1500,
       ...                'seed_rng': i,
       ...                'saving_fitness': 1,
       ...                'x': np.ones((10,)),
       ...                'sigma': 1e-9,
       ...                'lr_sigma': 1.0/(1.0 + 10.0/3.0),
       ...                'is_restart': False}
       ...     res = RES(problem, options)
       ...     fitness = res.optimize()['fitness']
       ...     plt.plot(fitness[:, 0], np.sqrt(fitness[:, 1]), 'b')  # sqrt for distance
       ...     plt.xticks([0, 500, 1000, 1500])
       ...     plt.xlim([0, 1500])
       ...     plt.yticks([1e-9, 1e-6, 1e-3, 1e0])
       ...     plt.yscale('log')
       >>> plt.show()

For Advanced Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following the recent suggestion from one end-user, we add `EARLY_STOPPING
<https://github.com/Evolutionary-Intelligence/pypop/blob/main/pypop7/optimizers/core/optimizer.py#L13>`_ as the
fourth termination signal. Please refer to `#issues/175
<https://github.com/Evolutionary-Intelligence/pypop/issues/175>`_ for details.

Algorithm Selection and Configuration
-------------------------------------

.. note:: `"It is the long-term expectation that a theoretical framework will provide guidance to those faced with an
   optimization problem and the associated difficult choice of selecting a suitable method. ...In practice, algorithm
   parameters are typically tuned for each new problem."---[Spall et al., 2006]
   <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-84628-095-8_3>`_

For most real-world black-box optimization, typically there is **few** a prior knowledge to serve as the base of algorithm
selection. Perhaps the simplest way to algorithm selection is **trial-and-error**. However, here we still hope to provide
a *rule of thumb* to guide algorithm selection according to algorithm classification. Refer to `our GitHub homepage
<https://github.com/Evolutionary-Intelligence/pypop>`_ for details about three different classification families
(only based on the dimensionality). It is worthwhile noting that this classification is *just a very rough estimation*
for algorithm selection. In practice, the algorithm selection should depend mainly on the performance criteria to be
focused (e.g., convergence rate and final solution quality) and maximal runtime to be available.

In the future, we expect to add the **Automated Algorithm Selection and Configuration** techniques into this open-source
library, as shown below (just to name a few):
