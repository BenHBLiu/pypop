This `open-source <https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1711737838889242880>`_ Python library for **large-scale
black-box optimization** (PyPop7) was supported by Shenzhen Fundamental Research Program under Grant No.
JCYJ20200109141235597 (2000000 Yuan granted to Prof. Shi from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)
@Shenzhen, China from 2021 to 2023), and actively developed by three of his group members (*Qiqi Duan* also in Harbin
Institute of Technology, *Chang Shao* also in University of Technology Sydney, and *Guochen Zhou* also in Zhejiang
University).

  * Now *Zhuowei Wang* from University of Technology Sydney (UTS) takes part in this library as one core developer (for
    testing before 2024).
  * Now *Mingyang Feng* from University of Birmingham (UoB)/University of Electronic Science and Technology of China helps
    to search papers involved in this library and test on MacOS X.
  * Now *Yijun Yang* from UTS/Beihang University helps to suggest papers about Bayesian Optimization (BO).
  * Now *Qi Zhao* from SUSTech helps to proofread the documents.
  * Now *Haobin Yang* from SUSTech helps to proofread and standardize the documents.
  * Now *Minghan Zhang* from University of Warwick/Imperial College London helps to search papers involved in this library
    and test on MacOS X.
  * Now *Zonghan He* from SUSTech helps to test the installation process on Windows10 OS (before 2024).
  * Now *Yajing Tan* from SUSTech is added as one of core developers in order to increase new black-box optimizers.
  * Now *Jian Zeng* from Guangdong Police College/Harbin Institute of Technology helps to collect BBOs for data mining.
  * Now *XiangLong Chen* from SUSTech helps to proofread and standardize the documents.
  * Now *Yuwei Huang* from SUSTech is added as one of core developers in order to increase new black-box optimizers.
  * From 2024/5/1, *Xingyu Zhou* from SUSTech is added as one of **core developers** in order to code and check new
    black-box optimizers from the machine learning (ML) community.

We also acknowledge the initial (2017) discussions with Hao Tong (when at SUSTech, now at UoB) and recent (2022) discussions
wih Changwu Huang (at SUSTech).

Finally, we thank very much for all the following open-source code to make **repeatability** much easier (still updated):
